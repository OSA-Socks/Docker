# Docker Instructions
## What?
This README will guide you through the following:
- [Choosing a VPN](#choosing-a-vpn)
- [Installing Docker](#installing-docker)
- [Creating your Docker Compose](#creating-your-docker-compose)
- [Deploying](#deploying)
- [And what to do after that](#what-now)

## Foreword
This guide is NOT a crash course on ANY of the following:
- Docker & Docker Compose
- HTTP/HTTPS
- SOCKS
- The Shell
- Linux
Please acquaint yourself with these tools to an intermediate level before continuing.
The majority of these instructions will be for linux, some adaptation may be required for windows machines (although, if you care about your privacy in 2025, you may want to switch to linux too).

## Choosing a VPN
The easiest and most reliable way to host your own socks proxy is with gluetun and docker compose.
For this, a paid VPN provider is required: Personally, I believe the best are [Proton](https://protonvpn.com/) and [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en).
Either way, ensure your VPN of choice has a strict no log policy.
